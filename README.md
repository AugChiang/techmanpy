# Python Driver for Techman Robots

This repository contains a communication driver for Techman robots written in Python.  
It extends the official [tmr_ros1](https://github.com/TechmanRobotInc/tmr_ros1) C++ communication driver by providing fine-grained semantics.

Documentation will soon be added.
